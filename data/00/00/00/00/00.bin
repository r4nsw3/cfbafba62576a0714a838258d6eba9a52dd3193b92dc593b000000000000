  |   Update/Patch Notes: v1.2.1 (v196608).                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Easy Mode - This was the single most requested feature that we        |
  |   heard from both Nintendo Life readers and the web as a whole. It      |
  |   was a tough at first as we were getting other feedback saying that    |
  |   the game was too easy. So this patch now gives you an easier mode     |
  |   to play with which includes...                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Boss Checkpoints - The other big request was boss checkpoints. For    |
  |   the folks struggling with the difficulty the check-pointing was       |
  |   making things even harder, so there is now a checkpoint before each   |
  |   boss!                                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   BEAST mode - This is the extra mode that is currently locked on the   |
  |   main menu. Once you've complete the game this unlocks and, well,      |
  |   let's just say you'll be wanting to play the game through again!      |
  |   For those that have completed the game on other systems and had       |
  |   access to this mode, they've loved it and we hope you do to. Its      |
  |   seriously good fun!                                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Performance boost - We've been able to reduce the loading times       |
  |   between levels! We've also boosted the frame rate in a many areas     |
  |   too.                                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Missing achievements - A few folks had mentioned that their           |
  |   achievement's had disappeared. Worry not, they'd not gone, they       |
  |   just weren't visible due to a small glitch which has now been         |
  |   quashed.                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Bug fixes - We've addressed all the known bugs in the game and they   |
  |   should all now be gone.                                               |
